# Session 11 — Summary

**Date:** 2026-05-20 (timezone-picker UX overhaul + Pinned Timezones)

> **Scope (from the prompt).** Three gated phases reshaping timezone selection
> across Free v1: **Phase 1** — research + build a curated timezone dataset to
> replace the raw ~600-entry IANA list; **Phase 2** — refactor the shared
> `TimezonePicker` to use it (search + display); **Phase 3** — add Pinned
> Timezones (onboarding capture + sectioned dropdown). Each phase gated on the
> previous. Phase 1 gated on owner approval of the dataset.

> **FINAL STATE (close-out, 2026-05-20).** Everything is on **`origin/main`**
> (HEAD `7c7a0cf`, pushed). The session ran well past the three planned phases
> into several owner hands-on iterations — read **§g2–§g4** alongside §a–§f
> (those were written at the phase-3 build point, so their tallies/"not pushed"
> notes are superseded here). Authoritative final numbers: **242 tests** green;
> **~69** curated timezone rows; typecheck/lint/format/build + tier-split all
> clean. Net deliverables: curated dataset → searchable picker (Option-B label
> grammar) → Pinned Timezones → primary-tz + inline "remove all" +
> commit-on-Continue/Back-reverts onboarding nav → sticky banded section
> headers → a coverage regression test closing the +12 no-DST gap.

## a. What landed (built locally; later pushed — see FINAL STATE above)

- `f78aa02` — **Phase 1: curated dataset.** `src/lib/timezone/curated-timezones.ts`
  (+ tests). ~50 → (after the Phase-2 relabel) ~64 timezone GROUPS, each with a
  UTC-offset label, region/cities, abbreviations, rich `searchTerms`, and an
  `observesDST` flag. Stored value stays a canonical IANA id. **16 validation
  tests recompute every entry's standard offset + DST flag from the platform's
  own tz data and assert it matches what was hand-authored** — so all geographic
  facts are machine-verified, not trusted. Web-verified the volatile 2022–2026
  changes (Mexico/Iran/Türkiye/Jordan dropped DST; Egypt re-added; Kazakhstan →
  +5 in 2024; Paraguay → permanent −3; Greenland EU-aligned). **Owner-approved**
  at the Phase-1 gate (keep all entries incl. thin/edge; Greenland = Nuuk-only).
- `2d03753` — **Phase 2: searchable combobox.** Rebuilt the shared
  `TimezonePicker` from a native `<select>` over raw IANA ids into a custom
  searchable combobox over the curated dataset (`search.ts` + `zone-info.ts`).
  Friendly labels; case-insensitive substring search across
  label/abbr/searchTerms/typed-offset; "No timezones found" empty state;
  stored-value resolution for display (browser `Europe/Amsterdam` → CET group,
  legacy `Asia/Calcutta` → India, unknown → raw + hint, no silent migration);
  full keyboard + ARIA; **self-styled via a co-located `fl-tzp-` `<style>`
  block** so it renders identically on the onboarding page AND inside the
  modal's Shadow DOM. Both consumers still share the one component (spec (k)).
- `b0e101f` — **Phase 2 fix (owner hands-on #1).** The popup grew the modal
  into a second scrollbar and wrapped rows. Made it a `position: fixed` overlay
  (anchored to the trigger, flips above when tight) so it floats like a native
  `<select>` menu — no modal scrollbar, no clipping — with `width: max-content`
  + single-line rows so it grows sideways instead of wrapping.
- `c434d8c` / `a9d6ddb` — **Phase 2 refine (owner hands-on #2).** "Split the
  worst, keep the rest": offsets shared by several unrelated sovereign nations
  (+8, +3, +5, +4, +9, +0, −6, +7) became one short row per country/place
  (each its own IANA id — fixes the "China, Singapore, … Singapore" jumble that
  named Singapore twice). Dropped every "(no DST)" note (DST signalled only by
  the abbr pair or a bare "(DST)"). All-caps queries now match abbreviations
  **case-sensitively** ("IST" → India/Israel, not "Istanbul"; "PST" → Pacific).
  *(Two commits because the conversation was branched mid-session via `/btw`;
  both are legitimate — `a9d6ddb` finalised the relabel + allowlist.)*
- `4a79ec2` — **Phase 3: Pinned Timezones.** New `pinnedTimezones: string[]`
  on state + draft (SCHEMA_VERSION 2→3, additive default-merge migration → []);
  `MAX_PINNED_TIMEZONES = 5`, `DEFAULT_PINNED_TIMEZONES` (PST/EST/GMT/CET/IST).
  Onboarding Step 2 reworked into "Set up your timezones" (user tz + pinned
  multi-select: chips + add-picker + 5-cap message + Skip→[]). Picker gains a
  `pinnedIanaIds` prop → "Pinned" / "All timezones" sections (an entry appears
  once; search filters both; keyboard spans both; no sections when empty).
  Pinned ids threaded content-script → modal → OptimizeSection → the §5.3.5 (i)
  picker. Settings stub + PRE_LAUNCH item note the future pinned-management UI.

**Tests: 184 → 239** (+16 dataset, +14 search, picker rewrite + sections, +5
storage v3/migration, +6 onboarding Step-2). Typecheck / lint / format / build
clean throughout. Tier-split audit clean (no `premium-v1` imports). Shared
`TimezonePicker-*.js` chunk still emitted once (~25 kB) — spec-(k) lock holds.

## b. Confidence (Entry 16) — per phase

- **Phase 1 (dataset): 4.5/5.** Every offset + DST flag is machine-verified
  against ICU; political groupings + recent changes web-verified and
  owner-approved. Half-point withheld on cross-cultural edge cases no test can
  cover (e.g. the deliberate imperfect folds: Cape Verde→Azores, Darwin→Adelaide,
  Fiji→NZ — a recipient in the folded region is an hour off during the other's
  summer; all flagged in-file).
- **Phase 2 (picker): 4/5.** Logic + a11y unit-tested; the two real-DOM issues
  (modal scrollbar, row wrapping) were owner-caught hands-on and fixed. The
  fixed-overlay relies on the shadow host having no transformed ancestor (true
  today — host is on `document.body`); if Gmail ever wraps it in a transform,
  the overlay would mis-anchor (would need a portal). Flagged.
- **Phase 3 (pinned): 4.5/5.** Storage, cap, skip, sections, migration all
  tested. The only place to manage pins post-onboarding is the not-yet-built
  Settings panel (tracked).

## c. Shortcuts / flag to a senior reviewer

- **The curated dataset deserves a human geographic/political pass.** Tests
  prove the *offsets* are right; they cannot prove the *groupings/labels* read
  well to someone from each region, or that the sovereign-entity phrasing is
  diplomatically clean everywhere. The 8 `FLAG` comments mark the judgment
  calls + imperfect folds.
- **Picker accessibility** is a hand-rolled ARIA combobox/listbox with
  fixed-overlay positioning — worth a screen-reader pass before launch.
- **Pinned storage schema** (`pinnedTimezones: string[]` on §7.2) is what the
  future Settings panel builds on; confirm the flat-array shape (vs the
  prompt's nested `{ ianaIdentifiers }`) is acceptable — chosen to match the
  existing camelCase flat schema (recipientCache etc.).

## d. Stale docs surfaced / handled

- PRD §5.1.3 Step 2 rewritten (single-purpose "Confirm your timezone" → dual
  "Set up your timezones" with pinned). §5.3.5 (k) updated (picker is now a
  searchable curated combobox + renders pinned). §5.8.2 gains pinned management.
- CLAUDE.md current-state + locked-decisions updated; SCHEMA_VERSION note (→3).

## e. Deferred into Session 12+

- **Settings panel build (§5.8)** — now the only surface to manage pinned
  timezones AND clear the manual recipient-tz cache (§5.8.2). Tracked in
  PRE_LAUNCH_CHECKLIST. Likely Session-12 headline.
- **§5.3.5 end-to-end live check** (cache-miss → pick tz → real scheduled send)
  — still the one un-driven path from Session 10, now layered with the new
  picker; owner did hands-on the picker UX but not a full scheduled send.
- §5.5.1 regular-Send warning hardening; Free-v1 pre-launch (brand, Privacy/
  Terms, Web Store, Workspace Schedule-Send probe).

## f. Honest gaps — hands-on covered vs not

- **Owner hands-on covered:** the picker opening/searching in the Optimize
  modal, the double-scrollbar + wrapping fixes, the +8-row jumble. The owner
  then asked to run straight through without further per-change verification.
- **NOT driven:** onboarding Step 2 against a real install (the pinned chips/
  cap/skip flow is unit-tested only); a full Optimize-for-X scheduled send with
  a pinned zone selected; screen-reader a11y. The fixed-overlay's no-transform
  assumption is unverified against current live Gmail in this session.

## g. Owner-decisions-log

Two entries appended: **44** (curated dataset over raw IANA + the hands-on
picker-UX refinements) and **45** (Pinned Timezones as a new feature).

## g2. Post-hands-on Step-2 refinements (2026-05-20, owner)

After the close-out commit, owner hands-on of the rendered onboarding Step 2
drove three more changes (commit `680cc66`; owner-decisions Entry 45 addendum):
(1) the standalone "Skip" link folded into the at-cap message as an inline
"**remove all**"; the long footer dropped, its gist moved under the timezone
field. (2) The user's-own timezone made **visually primary** (tinted card +
bold label) so the eye lands there before the optional pinned chips. (3)
**Commit-on-Continue**: a step's edits commit only on Continue; **Back restores
the step's on-entry snapshot** (`useOnboarding`), so accidentally clearing the
pre-selected pins then going Back no longer loses them — applies to all steps,
memory-only so §5.1.4 resume is unaffected. 240 tests green. PRD §5.1.3
amendment updated.

## g3. Curated-label "Option B" grammar (2026-05-20, owner)

Owner re-opened the row-grouping choice and picked a 4th custom option (commit
`36b3dea`; owner-decisions Entry 44 addendum). The labels now follow a fixed
grammar: zone-name + cities (grouped country-by-country, no country names) |
single country + its cities | bare country list — never a country name mixed
with another country's cities; never interleaved cities. India/Sri Lanka,
UK/Ireland/Portugal, Thailand/Vietnam/Indonesia and Japan/Korea split into
one-country rows (new IANA ids Europe/Dublin, Europe/Lisbon, Asia/Colombo,
Asia/Ho_Chi_Minh). ~68 rows; 240 tests green (the ICU validator re-verified the
new split zones). The CLAUDE.md "Locked decisions" bullet carries the grammar.

## g4. Coverage gap check (2026-05-20, owner-requested)

Owner asked which IANA zones the runtime knows aren't mapped to a curated row
(would show the "pick to update" fallback). A discovery pass over
`Intl.supportedValuesOf("timeZone")` (418 zones) found **18 unresolved** — none
breakages, all graceful fallbacks. Only one cluster had meaningful population:
**`+12:00` no-DST** (Russia Far East Kamchatka/Anadyr; Marshall Islands,
Kiribati-Gilbert, Tuvalu, Nauru; plus Fiji, which had been mis-resolving to
NZ/DST). Owner chose to **add one row** — `(UTC+12:00) Fiji, Marshall Islands,
Kiribati` (`Pacific/Fiji`, Kamchatka folded to search) — closing that gap and
giving Fiji a correct no-DST home; the other 9 combos (Pitcairn ~50, Eucla
~200, Lord Howe, Norfolk, Noronha, Miquelon, Gambier, Marquesas, Adak — all
sub-10k / remote) stay graceful. Added a **permanent coverage regression test**
(`coverage.test.ts`) that fails the build if a future tzdb update or dataset
edit opens a NEW gap (9 edge zones explicitly allowlisted). ~69 rows; 242 tests.

## h. Session 12 opening sequence (handoff)

1. Build the §5.8 Settings panel (pinned-timezone management + manual-cache
   clear surface + the other §5.8.2 sections). It unblocks editing both pieces
   of user data that currently only onboarding can set.
2. Owner hands-on of onboarding Step 2 (pinned chips/cap/skip) + a full
   Optimize-for-X scheduled send with a pinned recipient zone.
3. Session 12 prompt arrives separately.
